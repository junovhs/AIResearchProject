## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**
*(Describe the main goal of this experiment. What specific aspect of the Holoform concept or its implementation are we testing or developing?)*

**Hypothesis/Research Question(s):**
*(What do we expect to find or demonstrate? What specific questions are we trying to answer?)*
*(E.g., "The AST generator can be extended to correctly parse 'for' loop structures and represent them in the Holoform operations list.")*

## 2. Configuration

*   **Holoform System Components Used:**
    *   Holoform Generator Version/Commit: `[e.g., from ast_basic_generator.py at commit xyz789]`
    *   Holoform Interpreter Version/Commit: `[If applicable]`
    *   Holoform Data Structures Schema Version: `[If we formalize versions]`
*   **Input Data:**
    *   Source Code Snippets: `[Describe or list the Python code snippets used, e.g., G_helper_gt_variants, F_caller_gt, F_with_loop_gt]`
    *   Manually Crafted Holoforms: `[If used for comparison or as input to an interpreter]`
    *   Bug Reports / Queries: `[If testing AI interaction, e.g., "Button X not visible"]`
*   **Key Parameters/Settings:**
    *   `[Any specific configurations for the generator, interpreter, or test harness]`

## 3. Process / Methodology

*(Describe the steps taken in this experiment. Be clear enough for someone else (or future-you) to understand and potentially reproduce the experiment.)*
1.  `[Step 1, e.g., Modified HoloformGeneratorVisitor to include visit_For method.]`
2.  `[Step 2, e.g., Defined new ground truth Python code string F_WITH_LOOP_CODE_STR.]`
3.  `[Step 3, e.g., Defined EXPECTED_F_WITH_LOOP_OPERATIONS for validation.]`
4.  `[Step 4, e.g., Ran the updated test harness with the new scenario.]`

## 4. Results & Metrics

*(Present the findings of the experiment. Use tables, code blocks, or lists as appropriate.)*

**Quantitative Results:**
*   **Behavioral Fidelity Score (if applicable):** `[e.g., 100% (5/5 test cases passed)]`
*   **Holoform Generation Accuracy (vs. Expected Structure):**
    *   Scenario `[Scenario Name]`: `[e.g., ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL]`
        *   Description Extraction: `[✅/❌, details if failed]`
        *   Operation Structure: `[✅/❌, details if failed]`
*   **Focus Factor / Relevance (if applicable):** `[e.g., 2/5 Holoforms accessed]`
*   **Token Efficiency (Conceptual/Actual):** `[e.g., Approx. X tokens for Holoforms vs. Y for raw code]`
*   **Other relevant metrics...**

**Qualitative Results:**
*   Analysis of generated Holoform structures: `[e.g., "The 'for_loop' operation correctly nested body operations."]`
*   Quality of AI-generated explanations (if applicable): `[e.g., "Chain-of-thought was logical and correctly identified the step involving the G_helper call."]`
*   Observed limitations or unexpected behaviors.

*(Example Table for a generation task)*
| Test Scenario         | Description Extraction | Op Structure Match | Overall Result |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- | :------------- |
| `[e.g., f_with_loop]` | ✅ SUCCESS             | ✅ SUCCESS         | ✅ PASS        |
| `...`                 | ...                    | ...                | ...            |


## 5. Analysis & Discussion

*(Interpret the results. What do they mean in the context of our research questions and the overall Holoform project?)*
*   Were the hypotheses supported or refuted?
*   What are the strengths of the current approach demonstrated by this experiment?
*   What are the weaknesses or limitations identified?
*   How do these findings compare to previous experiments or established knowledge (from our research surveys)?

## 6. Conclusion & Next Steps for this Line of Inquiry

*   **Summary Conclusion:** `[e.g., "The AST generator can now successfully parse and represent simple 'for' loops, further validating the AST-based approach for automated Holoform generation."]`
*   **Implications for Holoform Project:** `[How does this move us closer to our grand vision?]`
*   **Recommended Next Steps (for this specific experimental thread):**
    1.  `[e.g., Attempt to parse 'while' loops.]`
    2.  `[e.g., Refine parameter mapping extraction for more complex function call arguments.]`
    3.  `[e.g., Integrate these auto-generated Holoforms (with loops/calls) into the Simulated Zero-In POC.]`
