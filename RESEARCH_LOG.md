# Research Log: AI-Centric Codebase Abstraction (Holoform)

---

### 2024-05-22 – Repository Initialized & Foundational POC Planning
**Branch:** `main` (initial setup), then `exp/2025-05-22-baseline` (your example branch)
**Commit (Conceptual for this log entry):** `873707a` (initial scaffold commit from your history)
**Notes:**
*   Project repository established on GitHub: `https://github.com/junovhs/AIResearchProject`.
*   Initial discussions around Holoform concept: abstracting large codebases for AI token-efficient interaction, focusing on UI debugging scenarios ("button not showing up").
*   Outlined workflow for branch management, logging, and milestones.
*   Reviewed existing research survey on AI-assisted debugging, program slicing, GNNs, semantic search. This highlighted the relevance of hybrid approaches and the potential for Holoforms to be a central integrating abstraction.
*   Decision: Start with Proof-of-Concept (POC) implementations for core Holoform ideas.

### 2024-05-23 (Assumed Date - Update if different) – Inter-Holoform Call & Simulated Zero-In POCs (Manual Holoforms)
**Branch (Conceptual for this historical logging of prior work):** Based on work before `task/auto-gen-v1`.
**Commit (Conceptual for this historical logging):** My code output for "POC Enhancement v2: Graph-Contextualized Holoform Traversal & Explainable Pinpointing" (if versioned, would have a hash).
**Milestones.md Update:** Marked several sub-tasks in "Milestone 1" as complete.
**Key Findings & Results (POC v2 - Graph Contextualized Traversal):**
1.  Successfully simulated an AI "zeroing in" on a buggy component using manually crafted, linked Holoforms.
2.  Process:
    *   Simulated semantic search identified an entry-point Holoform (`H_F_caller`).
    *   AI (script) simulated execution of the *intended logic* via `H_F_caller` and its linked `H_G_helper` (correct specs).
    *   Comparison with actual buggy system output revealed a discrepancy.
3.  **Explainable Pinpointing:** AI generated a logical chain-of-thought, correctly identifying the component represented by `H_G_helper` as the likely source of the bug.
4.  **Token Efficiency:** Demonstrated conceptually.
**Conclusion:** Validated that linked, abstract Holoforms can support efficient, reasoned fault localization with explainability for an AI. This forms a strong basis for "innovative nugget."

### 2024-05-23 (Assumed Date - Update if different) – Initial Automated Holoform Generation (AST for Simple Functions)
**Branch:** `task/auto-gen-v1`
**Commit:** `5369a68` (Your latest commit hash for "Fix: add missing 're' import and refine description/comment parsing in AST generator")
**Milestones.md Update:** Marked "Sub-Task 2.1" in "Milestone 2" as complete.
**Key Findings & Results (AST Generator v1.1 for `G_helper` variants):**
1.  Developed `ast_basic_generator.py` to parse simple Python functions using the `ast` module.
2.  Successfully extracted:
    *   Function name, input parameters, output variable name.
    *   Assignment operations and their expression structure (as an AST string representation).
    *   Function `description` from docstrings (prioritized) or comment blocks immediately preceding the function. Successfully handled multi-line cases for both.
    *   Operation-level `semantic_purpose` from inline comments next to assignments.
3.  **All defined test scenarios (`with_docstring`, `with_comment_only`, `no_desc_defined`) passed** for description extraction and core operational detail generation for `G_helper`-like functions.
4.  **Identified Areas for Next Iteration:** The generator currently doesn't handle function calls within the parsed function's body (needed for `F_caller_gt`).
**Conclusion:** Achieved a successful first step in programmatically generating Holoforms from source code. The ability to capture human-authored semantic information (docstrings, comments) alongside structural details is a key win.
**Next Steps for this Branch (`task/auto-gen-v1`):**
*   Enhance `ast_basic_generator.py` to parse and represent *function calls* found within the body of the function being analyzed (e.g., `F_caller_gt` calling `G_helper_gt`).
