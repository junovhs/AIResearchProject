# Results Directory

This directory is for storing and organizing the aggregated outputs, key findings, and summarized artifacts from the Holoform research experiments. While raw logs or intermediate data might reside within specific experiment folders (under `../experiments/`), this `results/` directory should focus on more polished and synthesized information.

## Purpose:

*   To provide a central place for consolidated views of research progress.
*   To store figures, tables, and charts that summarize important metrics and findings.
*   To house drafts or final versions of reports, papers, or presentations derived from the research.
*   To track the performance of different Holoform generation techniques or AI interaction strategies against defined benchmarks or test cases.

## Suggested Organization:

Results can be organized by:

*   **Milestones:** Sub-folders corresponding to major milestones (e.g., `milestone-1_foundational_pocs/`, `milestone-2_ast_generation_basics/`).
*   **Research Themes:** Sub-folders for specific areas of investigation (e.g., `ast_generator_performance/`, `ai_debugging_accuracy/`, `token_efficiency_studies/`).
*   **Publication/Report:** If working towards a specific paper or report, a sub-folder for its related result artifacts.

## Content Examples:

*   **Metrics Tables:** CSVs or Markdown tables summarizing key metrics (Behavioral Fidelity, Focus Factor, Token Efficiency, etc.) across different experiments or Holoform versions.
*   **Plots & Charts:** Generated images (e.g., PNGs, SVGs) visualizing trends, comparisons, or performance (like the Research Landscape chart). Ensure source data or scripts to regenerate plots are linked or included.
*   **Summary Reports:** Concise summaries of findings from a series of experiments.
*   **Qualitative Analysis Summaries:** Synthesized observations from evaluating Holoform quality, AI explanations, etc.

## Guidelines:

*   Keep this directory focused on *summarized* and *significant* results.
*   Link back to the specific experiment reports in the `../experiments/` directory for detailed methodology and raw data.
*   Use clear naming conventions for files and folders.
*   Version control for result artifacts is important, especially for figures and tables used in publications.
